## Purrr

Purrr is a package that aims to provide "A complete and consistent functional
programming toolkit for R."

Functional Programming is a [Declarative Programming Paradigm][1] that treats
computation as the evaluation of [Mathematical Functions][2].

From a [Mango blog post][6]

> FP is the process of writing code in a structured way and through functions
> remove code duplications and redundancies. In effect, computations or 
> evaluations are treated as mathematical functions and the output of a function
> only depends on the values of its inputs â€“ known as arguments. FP ensures that
> any side-effects such as changes in state do not affect the expected output
> such that if you call the same function twice with the same arguments the
> function returns the same output.


As of version 0.3.3 there are some 177 functions exported by purrr!

Fortunately, most of these functions are variants of one another, and some 65 of
these functions all fall under the same family of "map" functions.

## map

.pull-left[
map is a function that takes a vector (or list) and another function for which
each item from the input vector (or list) is evaluated against.

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
map <- function(.x, .f, ...)
```

map returns a list - but you can use the map_ variants if you want to return
a specific type of data as a vector:

* map_chr for a character vector
* map_dbl for a numeric vector
* map_lgl for a logical (`TRUE`/`FALSE`) vector
* map_int for an integer vector
* map_raw for a raw rector
* map_dfr if your function returns dataframes and you want to bind by rows (rbind)
* map_dfc if your function returns dataframes and you want to bind by columns (cbind)

map is very similar to the apply family of functions in Base R, but provide a
much simpler and more consistent programming interface.

## simple map examples

.pull-left[
Let's say we have a function
```{r}
fn <- function(x, a) { x^2 + a }
```

We can use map to iterate over the numbers from 1 to 5 and return the results as
a list.

```{r}
map(1:5, fn, 3)
```
]
.pull-right[
If we want to simplify the results, we can use the map_dbl function, which will
give us the results as a numeric vector.

We can also define functions inside of map. We can either write out the full
function syntax, or we can use a formula syntax like:

```{r}
map_dbl(1:5, ~.x^2 + 3)
```

in the formula syntax the argument is called `.x`.

.small[
of course, if your function is vectorised you could just call `fn(1:5, 3)`...

## reading in csv's from a folder

```{r}
files <- dir("data/ae_attendances/",
             "^\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}.csv$",
             full.names = TRUE)
# set the name of each item in the vector to be the date part of the file
names(files) <- files %>% str_extract("\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}.csv")
# map over the list of files, read each csv, add a column called "file" with the
# value of the name of the item.
ae_attendances <- map_dfr(files, read_csv, col_types = "Dccddd", .id = "file")

ae_attendances %>%
  head(5) %>%
  knitr::kable(format="html")
```

## map2: map over two lists

.pull-left[
Let's generate a table with random binomially distributed values:

```{r}
df <- tibble(i = 1:20) %>%
  mutate(N = rpois(max(i), 100)) %>%
  mutate(p = map_dbl(N, rbinom,
                     n = 1, prob = 0.75))

df %>%
  head(5) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```
]

.pull-right[
we can use `map2` to iterate over the pairs of numbers in the `N` and `p`
columns, and use the `BinomCI` function (from `DescTools`) to calculate
confidence intervals.

```{r}
df %>%
  mutate(confint = map2(p, N, BinomCI) %>%
           map(as_tibble)) %>%
  unnest(cols = "confint") %>%
  head(5) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```
]

## Other map functions

.pull-left[
#### pmap

If you have more than 2 items you need to map over, then you want pmap:

Your input must be a list, and each item in the list must contain the same
number of items.

```{r}
list(x = 1:3, y = 4:6, z = 7:9) %>%
  pmap_dbl(function(x, y, z) x^y+z)
```

If you pass in a dataframe then it will run a function for each row.

The functions arguments need to match the name of the items in the list/columns
in the dataframe rather than by position.
]

.pull-right[
#### imap

imap works just like map, except it adds an "index" value, so your function call
will be function(.x, .i).

#### walk

walk/walk2/pwalk/iwalk works calls the function for it's side effects, but it
returns it's original input. Useful for things like calling `rmarkdown::render`.

#### modify

For when your output is going to be the same type as your input. Can be  awkward
as some functions subtly change the data type (e.g. integers cast to numerics).

## Other useful functions from purrr

.pull-left[
#### Composing multiple functions together

You can chain multiple map's together, for example:

```{r}
1:5 %>%
  map_dbl(~.x^2) %>%
  map_dbl(~.x+3)
```

the compose function allows us to combine functions together.

```{r}
map_dbl(1:5, compose(~.x^2, ~.x+3,
                     .dir="forward"))
```

by default, compose works backwards, like the mathematical "dot" composition,
you can change this by setting `.dir="forward"`.
]
.pull-right[
#### Partial application

We can partially apply functions arguments to create a new, simpler function.

```{r}
mean_na <- partial(mean, na.rm = TRUE)
mean_na(c(1:5, NA))
```

a good example of when partial can be useful is when used in combination with
compose: if we want to pass additional arguments to the second or 3 function in
the chain, then we will need to set these arguments with `partial` during the
`compose` call

```{r eval=FALSE}
compose(function_1,
        partial(function_2, arg = value),
        function_3)
```

## Using map to calculate confidence intervals in a tibble

.pull-left[
Below we take the `ae_attendances` data and sum to get just the monthly
performance values. We use the `BinomCI` function from the `DescTools` package
to calculate the percentage of attendances that "breached" the 4 hour target,
along with the 95% confidence intervals.

We wouldn't normally be able to call this function inside a tidy pipe because
it's expecting a single value for the `x` and `n` arguments. Using map2 we run
the function once for each pair of values. We compose with as_tibble to
convert the results into a table - this helps us in the next step to unnest this
column.
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ae_attendances %>%
  group_by(period) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(attendances, breaches),
               sum) %>%
  mutate(ci = map2(breaches,
                   attendances,
                   compose(as_tibble,
                           BinomCI))) %>%
  unnest(cols = c(ci)) %>%
  select_if(negate(is.list)) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(est:upr.ci), ~1-.x) %>%
  select(period, est, lwr.ci, upr.ci) %>%
  head(3) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```
